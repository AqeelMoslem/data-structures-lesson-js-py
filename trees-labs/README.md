## Overview

This lesson covers three similar, tree-based data structures:

- Binary trees.
- Tries.
- A self-balancing binary tree (aka, an AVL tree).

### Prerequisites

- Big O Notation
- Recursion

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Describe how binary trees and tries are structured.
- Determine whether breadth-first or depth-first traversal is a more efficient search method for a given situation.
- Identify scenarios in which binary trees and tries are used in programming.
- Implement a binary tree.
- Distinguish between a balanced and an unbalanced binary tree.
- Explain how an AVL tree balances itself.
- Balance a binary tree.
